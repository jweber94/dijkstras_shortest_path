# Project: Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm

## CAUTION: Under construction --> I just started this project. It is neither finished, nor is there a executable temporary state.
+ Currently I think about: 
    - A reasonable class structure
    - Reasonable interfaces between the classes
    - How to visualize the final result 
    - Maybe gpo away from eigen to STL vector, since there is no extensive use of linear algebra
